Classes to support module descriptors and creating configurations of modules
by means of resolution and service binding.
&lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
or method of any class or interface in this package will cause a {@link
java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown. Additionally,
invoking a method with an array or collection containing a {@code null} element
will cause a {@code NullPointerException}, unless otherwise specified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;resolution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;{@index &quot;Module Resolution&quot;}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Resolution is the process of computing how modules depend on each other.
The process occurs at compile time and run time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Resolution is a two-step process. The first step recursively enumerates
the &#39;requires&#39; directives of a set of root modules. If all the enumerated
modules are observable, then the second step computes their readability graph.
The readability graph embodies how modules depend on each other, which in
turn controls access across module boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Step 1: Recursive enumeration &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Recursive enumeration takes a set of module names, looks up each of their
module declarations, and for each module declaration, recursively enumerates:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; the module names given by the &#39;requires&#39; directives with the
&#39;transitive&#39; modifier, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; at the discretion of the host system, the module names given by
the &#39;requires&#39; directives without the &#39;transitive&#39; modifier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Module declarations are looked up in a set of observable modules. The set
of observable modules is determined in an implementation specific manner. The
set of observable modules may include modules with explicit declarations
(that is, with a {@code module-info.java} source file or {@code module-info.class}
file) and modules with implicit declarations (that is,
&lt;a href=&quot;ModuleFinder.html#automatic-modules&quot;&gt;automatic modules&lt;/a&gt;).
Because an automatic module has no explicit module declaration, it has no
&#39;requires&#39; directives of its own, although its name may be given by a
&#39;requires&#39; directive of an explicit module declaration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The set of root modules, whose names are the initial input to this
algorithm, is determined in an implementation specific manner. The set of
root modules may include automatic modules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If at least one automatic module is enumerated by this algorithm, then
every observable automatic module must be enumerated, regardless of whether
any of their names are given by &#39;requires&#39; directives of explicit module
declarations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If any of the following conditions occur, then resolution fails:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any root module is not observable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any module whose name is given by a &#39;requires&#39; directive with the
&#39;transitive&#39; modifier is not observable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the discretion of the host system, any module whose name is given
by a &#39;requires&#39; directive without the &#39;transitive&#39; modifier is not
observable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The algorithm in this step enumerates the same module name twice. This
indicates a cycle in the &#39;requires&#39; directives, disregarding any &#39;transitive&#39;
modifiers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, resolution proceeds to step 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Step 2: Computing the readability graph &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A &#39;requires&#39; directive (irrespective of &#39;transitive&#39;) expresses that
one module depends on some other module. The effect of the &#39;transitive&#39;
modifier is to cause additional modules to also depend on the other module.
If module M &#39;requires transitive N&#39;, then not only does M depend on N, but
any module that depends on M also depends on N. This allows M to be
refactored so that some or all of its content can be moved to a new module N
without breaking modules that have a &#39;requires M&#39; directive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Module dependencies are represented by the readability graph. The
readability graph is a directed graph whose vertices are the modules
enumerated in step 1 and whose edges represent readability between pairs of
modules. The edges are specified as follows:
&lt;p&gt; First, readability is determined by the &#39;requires&#39; directives of the
enumerated modules, disregarding any &#39;transitive&#39; modifiers:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; For each enumerated module A that &#39;requires&#39; B: A &quot;reads&quot; B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; For each enumerated module X that is automatic: X &quot;reads&quot; every
other enumerated module (it is &quot;as if&quot; an automatic module has &#39;requires&#39;
directives for every other enumerated module). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Second, readability is augmented to account for &#39;transitive&#39; modifiers:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; For each enumerated module A that &quot;reads&quot; B: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If B &#39;requires transitive&#39; C, then A &quot;reads&quot; C as well as B. This
augmentation is recursive: since A &quot;reads&quot; C, if C &#39;requires transitive&#39;
D, then A &quot;reads&quot; D as well as C and B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If B is an automatic module, then A &quot;reads&quot; every other enumerated
automatic module. (It is &quot;as if&quot; an automatic module has &#39;requires transitive&#39;
directives for every other enumerated automatic module).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Finally, every module &quot;reads&quot; itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If any of the following conditions occur in the readability graph, then
resolution fails:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; A module &quot;reads&quot; two or more modules with the same name. This includes
the case where a module &quot;reads&quot; another with the same name as itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two or more modules export a package with the same name to a module
that &quot;reads&quot; both. This includes the case where a module M containing package
p &quot;reads&quot; another module that exports p to M. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; A module M declares that it &#39;uses p.S&#39; or &#39;provides p.S with ...&#39; but
package p is neither in module M nor exported to M by any module that M
&quot;reads&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, resolution succeeds, and the result of resolution is the
readability graph.
&lt;h3&gt; Root modules &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The set of root modules at compile-time is usually the set of modules
being compiled. At run-time, the set of root modules is usually the
application module specified to the &#39;java&#39; launcher. When compiling code in
the unnamed module, or at run-time when the main application class is loaded
from the class path, then the default set of root modules is implementation
specific. In the JDK the default set of root modules contains every module
that is observable on the upgrade module path or among the system modules,
and that exports at least one package without qualification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Observable modules &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The set of observable modules at both compile-time and run-time is
determined by searching several different paths, and also by searching
the compiled modules built in to the environment. The search order is as
follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; At compile time only, the compilation module path. This path
contains module definitions in source form.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The upgrade module path. This path contains compiled definitions of
modules that will be observed in preference to the compiled definitions of
any &lt;i&gt;upgradeable modules&lt;/i&gt; that are present in (3) and (4). See the Java
SE Platform for the designation of which standard modules are upgradeable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The system modules, which are the compiled definitions built in to
the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The application module path. This path contains compiled definitions
of library and application modules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; &#39;requires&#39; directives with &#39;static&#39; modifier &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &#39;requires&#39; directives that have the &#39;static&#39; modifier express an optional
dependence at run time. If a module declares that it &#39;requires static M&#39; then
resolution does not search the observable modules for M to satisfy the dependency.
However, if M is recursively enumerated at step 1 then all modules that are
enumerated and <code>requires static M</code> will read M. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Completeness &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Resolution may be partial at compile-time in that the complete transitive
closure may not be required to compile a set of modules. Minimally, the
readability graph that is constructed and validated at compile-time includes
the modules being compiled, their direct dependences, and all implicitly
declared dependences (requires transitive). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; At run-time, resolution is an additive process. The recursive enumeration
at step 1 may be relative to previous resolutions so that a root module,
or a module named in a &#39;requires&#39; directive, is not enumerated when it was
enumerated by a previous (or parent) resolution. The readability graph that
is the result of resolution may therefore have a vertex for a module enumerated
in step 1 but with an edge to represent that the module reads a module that
was enumerated by previous (or parent) resolution. &lt;/p&gt;

Provides classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java
programming language. The most important classes are {@code
Object}, which is the root of the class hierarchy, and {@code
Class}, instances of which represent classes at run time.
&lt;p&gt;Frequently it is necessary to represent a value of primitive
type as if it were an object. The wrapper classes {@code Boolean},
{@code Character}, {@code Integer}, {@code Long}, {@code Float},
and {@code Double} serve this purpose.  An object of type {@code
Double}, for example, contains a field whose type is double,
representing that value in such a way that a reference to it can be
stored in a variable of reference type.  These classes also provide
a number of methods for converting among primitive values, as well
as supporting such standard methods as equals and hashCode.  The
{@code Void} class is a non-instantiable class that holds a
reference to a {@code Class} object representing the type void.
&lt;p&gt;The class {@code Math} provides commonly used mathematical
functions such as sine, cosine, and square root. The classes {@code
String}, {@code StringBuffer}, and {@code StringBuilder} similarly
provide commonly used operations on character strings.
&lt;p&gt;Classes {@code ClassLoader}, {@code Process}, {@code
ProcessBuilder}, {@code Runtime}, {@code SecurityManager}, and
{@code System} provide &quot;system operations&quot; that manage the dynamic
loading of classes, creation of external processes, host
environment inquiries such as the time of day, and enforcement of
security policies.
&lt;p&gt;Class {@code Throwable} encompasses objects that may be thrown
by the {@code throw} statement. Subclasses of {@code Throwable}
represent errors and exceptions.
&lt;a id=&quot;charenc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Character Encodings&lt;/h2&gt;
The specification of the {@link java.nio.charset.Charset
java.nio.charset.Charset} class describes the naming conventions
for character encodings as well as the set of standard encodings
that must be supported by every implementation of the Java
platform.

{@code Cleaner} manages a set of object references and corresponding cleaning actions.
&lt;p&gt;
Cleaning actions are {@link #register(Object object, Runnable action) registered}
to run after the cleaner is notified that the object has become
phantom reachable.
The cleaner uses {@link PhantomReference} and {@link ReferenceQueue} to be
notified when the &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#reachability&quot;&gt;reachability&lt;/a&gt;
changes.
&lt;p&gt;
Each cleaner operates independently, managing the pending cleaning actions
and handling threading and termination when the cleaner is no longer in use.
Registering an object reference and corresponding cleaning action returns
a {@link Cleanable Cleanable}. The most efficient use is to explicitly invoke
the {@link Cleanable#clean clean} method when the object is closed or
no longer needed.
The cleaning action is a {@link Runnable} to be invoked at most once when
the object has become phantom reachable unless it has already been explicitly cleaned.
Note that the cleaning action must not refer to the object being registered.
If so, the object will not become phantom reachable and the cleaning action
will not be invoked automatically.
&lt;p&gt;
The execution of the cleaning action is performed
by a thread associated with the cleaner.
All exceptions thrown by the cleaning action are ignored.
The cleaner and other cleaning actions are not affected by
exceptions in a cleaning action.
The thread runs until all registered cleaning actions have
completed and the cleaner itself is reclaimed by the garbage collector.
&lt;p&gt;
The behavior of cleaners during {@link System#exit(int) System.exit}
is implementation specific. No guarantees are made relating
to whether cleaning actions are invoked or not.
&lt;p&gt;
Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor or
method in this class will cause a
{@link java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown.
@apiNote
The cleaning action is invoked only after the associated object becomes
phantom reachable, so it is important that the object implementing the
cleaning action does not hold references to the object.
In this example, a static class encapsulates the cleaning state and action.
An &quot;inner&quot; class, anonymous or not,  must not be used because it implicitly
contains a reference to the outer instance, preventing it from becoming
phantom reachable.
The choice of a new cleaner or sharing an existing cleaner is determined
by the use case.
&lt;p&gt;
If the CleaningExample is used in a try-finally block then the
{@code close} method calls the cleaning action.
If the {@code close} method is not called, the cleaning action is called
by the Cleaner when the CleaningExample instance has become phantom reachable.
&lt;pre&gt;{@code
public class CleaningExample implements AutoCloseable {
// A cleaner, preferably one shared within a library
private static final Cleaner cleaner = &lt;cleaner&gt;;
static class State implements Runnable {
State(...) {
// initialize State needed for cleaning action
}
public void run() {
// cleanup action accessing State, executed at most once
}
}
private final State state;
private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable;
public CleaningExample() {
this.state = new State(...);
this.cleanable = cleaner.register(this, state);
}
public void close() {
cleanable.clean();
}
}
}&lt;/pre&gt;
The cleaning action could be a lambda but all too easily will capture
the object reference, by referring to fields of the object being cleaned,
preventing the object from becoming phantom reachable.
Using a static nested class, as above, will avoid accidentally retaining the
object reference.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a id=&quot;compatible-cleaners&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Cleaning actions should be prepared to be invoked concurrently with
other cleaning actions.
Typically the cleaning actions should be very quick to execute
and not block. If the cleaning action blocks, it may delay processing
other cleaning actions registered to the same cleaner.
All cleaning actions registered to a cleaner should be mutually compatible.
