A &lt;i&gt;thread&lt;/i&gt; is a thread of execution in a program. The Java
Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of
execution running concurrently.
&lt;p&gt;
Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are
executed in preference to threads with lower priority. Each thread
may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running in
some thread creates a new {@code Thread} object, the new
thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the
creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the
creating thread is a daemon.
&lt;p&gt;
When a Java Virtual Machine starts up, there is usually a single
non-daemon thread (which typically calls the method named
{@code main} of some designated class). The Java Virtual
Machine continues to execute threads until either of the following
occurs:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The {@code exit} method of class {@code Runtime} has been
called and the security manager has permitted the exit operation
to take place.
&lt;li&gt;All threads that are not daemon threads have died, either by
returning from the call to the {@code run} method or by
throwing an exception that propagates beyond the {@code run}
method.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are two ways to create a new thread of execution. One is to
declare a class to be a subclass of {@code Thread}. This
subclass should override the {@code run} method of class
{@code Thread}. An instance of the subclass can then be
allocated and started. For example, a thread that computes primes
larger than a stated value could be written as follows:
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
class PrimeThread extends Thread {
long minPrime;
PrimeThread(long minPrime) {
this.minPrime = minPrime;
}
public void run() {
// compute primes larger than minPrime
&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.
}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);
p.start();
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other way to create a thread is to declare a class that
implements the {@code Runnable} interface. That class then
implements the {@code run} method. An instance of the class can
then be allocated, passed as an argument when creating
{@code Thread}, and started. The same example in this other
style looks like the following:
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
class PrimeRun implements Runnable {
long minPrime;
PrimeRun(long minPrime) {
this.minPrime = minPrime;
}
public void run() {
// compute primes larger than minPrime
&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.
}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);
new Thread(p).start();
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Every thread has a name for identification purposes. More than
one thread may have the same name. If a name is not specified when
a thread is created, a new name is generated for it.
&lt;p&gt;
Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be
thrown.

@apiNote
As an example consider a method in a class that spins in a loop until
some flag is set outside of that method. A call to the {@code onSpinWait}
method should be placed inside the spin loop.
&lt;pre&gt;{@code
class EventHandler {
volatile boolean eventNotificationNotReceived;
void waitForEventAndHandleIt() {
while ( eventNotificationNotReceived ) {
java.lang.Thread.onSpinWait();
}
readAndProcessEvent();
}
void readAndProcessEvent() {
// Read event from some source and process it
. . .
}
}
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The code above would remain correct even if the {@code onSpinWait}
method was not called at all. However on some architectures the Java
Virtual Machine may issue the processor instructions to address such
code patterns in a more beneficial way.

&lt;p&gt;This constructor is identical to {@link</p>

<h1>Thread(ThreadGroup,Runnable,String)} with the exception of the fact</h1>

<p>that it allows the thread stack size to be specified.  The stack size
is the approximate number of bytes of address space that the virtual
machine is to allocate for this thread&#39;s stack.  &lt;b&gt;The effect of the
{@code stackSize} parameter, if any, is highly platform dependent.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some platforms, specifying a higher value for the
{@code stackSize} parameter may allow a thread to achieve greater
recursion depth before throwing a {@link StackOverflowError}.
Similarly, specifying a lower value may allow a greater number of
threads to exist concurrently without throwing an {@link
OutOfMemoryError} (or other internal error).  The details of
the relationship between the value of the {@code stackSize} parameter
and the maximum recursion depth and concurrency level are
platform-dependent.  &lt;b&gt;On some platforms, the value of the
{@code stackSize} parameter may have no effect whatsoever.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virtual machine is free to treat the {@code stackSize}
parameter as a suggestion.  If the specified value is unreasonably low
for the platform, the virtual machine may instead use some
platform-specific minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably
high, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific
maximum.  Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified
value up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).
&lt;p&gt;Specifying a value of zero for the {@code stackSize} parameter will
cause this constructor to behave exactly like the
{@code Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String)} constructor.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior of this
constructor, extreme care should be exercised in its use.
The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will
likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.  In light of this
variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may be required,
and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation on
which an application is to run.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation note: Java platform implementers are encouraged to
document their implementation&#39;s behavior with respect to the
{@code stackSize} parameter.

Forces the thread to stop executing.
&lt;p&gt;
If there is a security manager installed, its {@code checkAccess}
method is called with {@code this}
as its argument. This may result in a
{@code SecurityException} being raised (in the current thread).
&lt;p&gt;
If this thread is different from the current thread (that is, the current
thread is trying to stop a thread other than itself), the
security manager&#39;s {@code checkPermission} method (with a
{@code RuntimePermission(&quot;stopThread&quot;)} argument) is called in
addition.
Again, this may result in throwing a
{@code SecurityException} (in the current thread).
&lt;p&gt;
The thread represented by this thread is forced to stop whatever
it is doing abnormally and to throw a newly created
{@code ThreadDeath} object as an exception.
&lt;p&gt;
It is permitted to stop a thread that has not yet been started.
If the thread is eventually started, it immediately terminates.
&lt;p&gt;
An application should not normally try to catch
{@code ThreadDeath} unless it must do some extraordinary
cleanup operation (note that the throwing of
{@code ThreadDeath} causes {@code finally} clauses of
{@code try} statements to be executed before the thread
officially dies).  If a {@code catch} clause catches a
{@code ThreadDeath} object, it is important to rethrow the
object so that the thread actually dies.
&lt;p&gt;
The top-level error handler that reacts to otherwise uncaught
exceptions does not print out a message or otherwise notify the
application if the uncaught exception is an instance of
{@code ThreadDeath}.

@deprecated This method is inherently unsafe.  Stopping a thread with
Thread.stop causes it to unlock all of the monitors that it
has locked (as a natural consequence of the unchecked
{@code ThreadDeath} exception propagating up the stack).  If
any of the objects previously protected by these monitors were in
an inconsistent state, the damaged objects become visible to
other threads, potentially resulting in arbitrary behavior.  Many
uses of {@code stop} should be replaced by code that simply
modifies some variable to indicate that the target thread should
stop running.  The target thread should check this variable
regularly, and return from its run method in an orderly fashion
if the variable indicates that it is to stop running.  If the
target thread waits for long periods (on a condition variable,
for example), the {@code interrupt} method should be used to
interrupt the wait.
