An object that may hold resources (such as file or socket handles)
until it is closed. The {@link #close()} method of an {@code AutoCloseable}
object is called automatically when exiting a {@code
try}-with-resources block for which the object has been declared in
the resource specification header. This construction ensures prompt
release, avoiding resource exhaustion exceptions and errors that
may otherwise occur.
@apiNote
&lt;p&gt;It is possible, and in fact common, for a base class to
implement AutoCloseable even though not all of its subclasses or
instances will hold releasable resources.  For code that must operate
in complete generality, or when it is known that the {@code AutoCloseable}
instance requires resource release, it is recommended to use {@code
try}-with-resources constructions. However, when using facilities such as
{@link java.util.stream.Stream} that support both I/O-based and
non-I/O-based forms, {@code try}-with-resources blocks are in
general unnecessary when using non-I/O-based forms.

This method is invoked automatically on objects managed by the
{@code try}-with-resources statement.
&lt;p&gt;While this interface method is declared to throw {@code
Exception}, implementers are &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; encouraged to
declare concrete implementations of the {@code close} method to
throw more specific exceptions, or to throw no exception at all
if the close operation cannot fail.
&lt;p&gt; Cases where the close operation may fail require careful
attention by implementers. It is strongly advised to relinquish
the underlying resources and to internally &lt;em&gt;mark&lt;/em&gt; the
resource as closed, prior to throwing the exception. The {@code
close} method is unlikely to be invoked more than once and so
this ensures that the resources are released in a timely manner.
Furthermore it reduces problems that could arise when the resource
wraps, or is wrapped, by another resource.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementers of this interface are also strongly advised
to not have the {@code close} method throw {@link
InterruptedException}.&lt;/em&gt;
This exception interacts with a thread&#39;s interrupted status,
and runtime misbehavior is likely to occur if an {@code
InterruptedException} is {@linkplain Throwable#addSuppressed
suppressed}.
More generally, if it would cause problems for an
exception to be suppressed, the {@code AutoCloseable.close}
method should not throw it.
&lt;p&gt;Note that unlike the {@link java.io.Closeable#close close}
method of {@link java.io.Closeable}, this {@code close} method
is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required to be idempotent.  In other words,
calling this {@code close} method more than once may have some
visible side effect, unlike {@code Closeable.close} which is
required to have no effect if called more than once.
However, implementers of this interface are strongly encouraged
to make their {@code close} methods idempotent.
