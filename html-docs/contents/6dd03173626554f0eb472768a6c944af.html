The {@code Throwable} class is the superclass of all errors and
exceptions in the Java language. Only objects that are instances of this
class (or one of its subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine or
can be thrown by the Java {@code throw} statement. Similarly, only
this class or one of its subclasses can be the argument type in a
{@code catch} clause.
For the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions, {@code
Throwable} and any subclass of {@code Throwable} that is not also a
subclass of either {@link RuntimeException} or {@link Error} are
regarded as checked exceptions.
&lt;p&gt;Instances of two subclasses, {@link java.lang.Error} and
{@link java.lang.Exception}, are conventionally used to indicate
that exceptional situations have occurred. Typically, these instances
are freshly created in the context of the exceptional situation so
as to include relevant information (such as stack trace data).
&lt;p&gt;A throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of its
thread at the time it was created. It can also contain a message
string that gives more information about the error. Over time, a
throwable can {@linkplain Throwable#addSuppressed suppress} other
throwables from being propagated.  Finally, the throwable can also
contain a &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt;: another throwable that caused this
throwable to be constructed.  The recording of this causal information
is referred to as the &lt;i&gt;chained exception&lt;/i&gt; facility, as the
cause can, itself, have a cause, and so on, leading to a &quot;chain&quot; of
exceptions, each caused by another.
&lt;p&gt;One reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the class that
throws it is built atop a lower layered abstraction, and an operation on
the upper layer fails due to a failure in the lower layer.  It would be bad
design to let the throwable thrown by the lower layer propagate outward, as
it is generally unrelated to the abstraction provided by the upper layer.
Further, doing so would tie the API of the upper layer to the details of
its implementation, assuming the lower layer&#39;s exception was a checked
exception.  Throwing a &quot;wrapped exception&quot; (i.e., an exception containing a
cause) allows the upper layer to communicate the details of the failure to
its caller without incurring either of these shortcomings.  It preserves
the flexibility to change the implementation of the upper layer without
changing its API (in particular, the set of exceptions thrown by its
methods).
&lt;p&gt;A second reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the method
that throws it must conform to a general-purpose interface that does not
permit the method to throw the cause directly.  For example, suppose
a persistent collection conforms to the {@link java.util.Collection
Collection} interface, and that its persistence is implemented atop
{@code java.io}.  Suppose the internals of the {@code add} method
can throw an {@link java.io.IOException IOException}.  The implementation
can communicate the details of the {@code IOException} to its caller
while conforming to the {@code Collection} interface by wrapping the
{@code IOException} in an appropriate unchecked exception.  (The
specification for the persistent collection should indicate that it is
capable of throwing such exceptions.)
&lt;p&gt;A cause can be associated with a throwable in two ways: via a
constructor that takes the cause as an argument, or via the
{@link #initCause(Throwable)} method.  New throwable classes that
wish to allow causes to be associated with them should provide constructors
that take a cause and delegate (perhaps indirectly) to one of the
{@code Throwable} constructors that takes a cause.
Because the {@code initCause} method is public, it allows a cause to be
associated with any throwable, even a &quot;legacy throwable&quot; whose
implementation predates the addition of the exception chaining mechanism to
{@code Throwable}.
&lt;p&gt;By convention, class {@code Throwable} and its subclasses have two
constructors, one that takes no arguments and one that takes a
{@code String} argument that can be used to produce a detail message.
Further, those subclasses that might likely have a cause associated with
them should have two more constructors, one that takes a
{@code Throwable} (the cause), and one that takes a
{@code String} (the detail message) and a {@code Throwable} (the
cause).

            <td><p>Prints this throwable and its backtrace to the
standard error stream. This method prints a stack trace for this
{@code Throwable} object on the error output stream that is
the value of the field {@code System.err}. The first line of
output contains the result of the {@link #toString()} method for
this object.  Remaining lines represent data previously recorded by
the method {@link #fillInStackTrace()}. The format of this
information depends on the implementation, but the following
example may be regarded as typical:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
java.lang.NullPointerException
at MyClass.mash(MyClass.java:9)
at MyClass.crunch(MyClass.java:6)
at MyClass.main(MyClass.java:3)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This example was produced by running the program:
&lt;pre&gt;
class MyClass {
public static void main(String[] args) {
crunch(null);
}
static void crunch(int[] a) {
mash(a);
}
static void mash(int[] b) {
System.out.println(b[0]);
}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
The backtrace for a throwable with an initialized, non-null cause
should generally include the backtrace for the cause.  The format
of this information depends on the implementation, but the following
example may be regarded as typical:
&lt;pre&gt;
HighLevelException: MidLevelException: LowLevelException
at Junk.a(Junk.java:13)
at Junk.main(Junk.java:4)
Caused by: MidLevelException: LowLevelException
at Junk.c(Junk.java:23)
at Junk.b(Junk.java:17)
at Junk.a(Junk.java:11)
... 1 more
Caused by: LowLevelException
at Junk.e(Junk.java:30)
at Junk.d(Junk.java:27)
at Junk.c(Junk.java:21)
... 3 more
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note the presence of lines containing the characters {@code &quot;...&quot;}.
These lines indicate that the remainder of the stack trace for this
exception matches the indicated number of frames from the bottom of the
stack trace of the exception that was caused by this exception (the
&quot;enclosing&quot; exception).  This shorthand can greatly reduce the length
of the output in the common case where a wrapped exception is thrown
from same method as the &quot;causative exception&quot; is caught.  The above
example was produced by running the program:
&lt;pre&gt;
public class Junk {
public static void main(String args[]) {
try {
a();
} catch(HighLevelException e) {
e.printStackTrace();
}
}
static void a() throws HighLevelException {
try {
b();
} catch(MidLevelException e) {
throw new HighLevelException(e);
}
}
static void b() throws MidLevelException {
c();
}
static void c() throws MidLevelException {
try {
d();
} catch(LowLevelException e) {
throw new MidLevelException(e);
}
}
static void d() throws LowLevelException {
e();
}
static void e() throws LowLevelException {
throw new LowLevelException();
}
}
class HighLevelException extends Exception {
HighLevelException(Throwable cause) { super(cause); }
}
class MidLevelException extends Exception {
MidLevelException(Throwable cause)  { super(cause); }
}
class LowLevelException extends Exception {
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
As of release 7, the platform supports the notion of
&lt;i&gt;suppressed exceptions&lt;/i&gt; (in conjunction with the {@code
try}-with-resources statement). Any exceptions that were
suppressed in order to deliver an exception are printed out
beneath the stack trace.  The format of this information
depends on the implementation, but the following example may be
regarded as typical:
&lt;pre&gt;
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.Exception: Something happened
at Foo.bar(Foo.java:10)
at Foo.main(Foo.java:5)
Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 0
at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
at Foo.bar(Foo.java:9)
... 1 more
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that the &quot;... n more&quot; notation is used on suppressed exceptions
just as it is used on causes. Unlike causes, suppressed exceptions are
indented beyond their &quot;containing exceptions.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;An exception can have both a cause and one or more suppressed
exceptions:
&lt;pre&gt;
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.Exception: Main block
at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:7)
Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 2
at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
Caused by: java.lang.Exception: I did it
at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:8)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Likewise, a suppressed exception can have a cause:
&lt;pre&gt;
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.Exception: Main block
at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:6)
Suppressed: Resource2$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
at Resource2.close(Resource2.java:20)
at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:5)
Caused by: java.lang.Exception: Rats, you caught me
at Resource2$CloseFailException.&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;(Resource2.java:45)
... 2 more

&lt;p&gt;The suppression behavior is enabled &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; disabled
{@linkplain #Throwable(String, Throwable, boolean, boolean) via
a constructor}.  When suppression is disabled, this method does
nothing other than to validate its argument.
&lt;p&gt;Note that when one exception {@linkplain</p>

<h1>initCause(Throwable) causes} another exception, the first</h1>

<p>exception is usually caught and then the second exception is
thrown in response.  In other words, there is a causal
connection between the two exceptions.
In contrast, there are situations where two independent
exceptions can be thrown in sibling code blocks, in particular
in the {@code try} block of a {@code try}-with-resources
statement and the compiler-generated {@code finally} block
which closes the resource.
In these situations, only one of the thrown exceptions can be
propagated.  In the {@code try}-with-resources statement, when
there are two such exceptions, the exception originating from
the {@code try} block is propagated and the exception from the
{@code finally} block is added to the list of exceptions
suppressed by the exception from the {@code try} block.  As an
exception unwinds the stack, it can accumulate multiple
suppressed exceptions.
&lt;p&gt;An exception may have suppressed exceptions while also being
caused by another exception.  Whether or not an exception has a
cause is semantically known at the time of its creation, unlike
whether or not an exception will suppress other exceptions
which is typically only determined after an exception is
thrown.
&lt;p&gt;Note that programmer written code is also able to take
advantage of calling this method in situations where there are
multiple sibling exceptions and only one can be propagated.
