# [Depricated] the hypervisor will no longer exsist in v2

```Java 
package com.Shinkson47.JGEL.BackEnd.Operation.ErrorManagement;

...
public class Hypervisor {
    ...
}
```

The Hypervisor is a static class which hosts, starts, and monitors JGEL and the application using JGEL.


# Public methods

```Java
public static void Start(JGEStartupScript script) {...}
```

The ```Start()``` method is how JGEL systems and the user's applications are started.
