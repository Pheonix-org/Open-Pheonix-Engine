A thread group represents a set of threads. In addition, a thread
group can also include other thread groups. The thread groups form
a tree in which every thread group except the initial thread group
has a parent.
&lt;p&gt;
A thread is allowed to access information about its own thread
group, but not to access information about its thread group&#39;s
parent thread group or any other thread groups.
@author  unascribed
@since   1.0
The locking strategy for this code is to try to lock only one level of the
tree wherever possible, but otherwise to lock from the bottom up.
That is, from child thread groups to parents.
This has the advantage of limiting the number of locks that need to be held
and in particular avoids having to grab the lock for the root thread group,
(or a global lock) which would be a source of contention on a
multi-processor system with many thread groups.
This policy often leads to taking a snapshot of the state of a thread group
and working off of that snapshot, rather than holding the thread group locked
while we work on the children.</p>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this thread group has a parent thread group, the

with the same two arguments.
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, this method checks to see if there is a

{@code uncaughtException} method is called with the same
two arguments.

argument is an instance of {@link ThreadDeath}. If so, nothing
special is done. Otherwise, a message containing the
thread&#39;s name, as returned from the thread&#39;s {@link
Thread#getName getName} method, and a stack backtrace,
using the {@code Throwable}&#39;s {@link
