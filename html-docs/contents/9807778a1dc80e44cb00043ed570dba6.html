            <td><p>Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is
supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by
{@link java.util.HashMap}.
&lt;p&gt;
The general contract of {@code hashCode} is:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
an execution of a Java application, the {@code hashCode} method
must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
used in {@code equals} comparisons on the object is modified.
This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
application to another execution of the same application.
&lt;li&gt;If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(Object)}
method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of
the two objects must produce the same integer result.
&lt;li&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required that if two objects are unequal
according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)}
method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the
two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
&lt;/ul&gt;
@implSpec
As far as is reasonably practical, the {@code hashCode} method defined
by class {@code Object} returns distinct integers for distinct objects.
@return  a hash code value for this object.
@see     java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)
@see     java.lang.System#identityHashCode</p></td>
          </tr>
          
          <tr>
            <td>public</td>
            <td><a href="2616935b404fb0e28ee77b97037b0ee4.html">equals(obj: Object): boolean</a></td>
            <td><p>Indicates whether some other object is &quot;equal to&quot; this one.
&lt;p&gt;
The {@code equals} method implements an equivalence relation
on non-null object references:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is &lt;i&gt;reflexive&lt;/i&gt;: for any non-null reference value
{@code x}, {@code x.equals(x)} should return
{@code true}.
&lt;li&gt;It is &lt;i&gt;symmetric&lt;/i&gt;: for any non-null reference values
{@code x} and {@code y}, {@code x.equals(y)}
should return {@code true} if and only if
{@code y.equals(x)} returns {@code true}.
&lt;li&gt;It is &lt;i&gt;transitive&lt;/i&gt;: for any non-null reference values
{@code x}, {@code y}, and {@code z}, if
{@code x.equals(y)} returns {@code true} and
{@code y.equals(z)} returns {@code true}, then
{@code x.equals(z)} should return {@code true}.
&lt;li&gt;It is &lt;i&gt;consistent&lt;/i&gt;: for any non-null reference values
{@code x} and {@code y}, multiple invocations of
{@code x.equals(y)} consistently return {@code true}
or consistently return {@code false}, provided no
information used in {@code equals} comparisons on the
objects is modified.
&lt;li&gt;For any non-null reference value {@code x},
{@code x.equals(null)} should return {@code false}.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The {@code equals} method for class {@code Object} implements
the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
that is, for any non-null reference values {@code x} and
{@code y}, this method returns {@code true} if and only
if {@code x} and {@code y} refer to the same object
({@code x == y} has the value {@code true}).
&lt;p&gt;
Note that it is generally necessary to override the {@code hashCode}
method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
general contract for the {@code hashCode} method, which states
that equal objects must have equal hash codes.
@param   obj   the reference object with which to compare.
@return  {@code true} if this object is the same as the obj
argument; {@code false} otherwise.

            <td><p>Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning
of &quot;copy&quot; may depend on the class of the object. The general
intent is that, for any object {@code x}, the expression:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
x.clone() != x&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
will be true, and that the expression:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
will be {@code true}, but these are not absolute requirements.
While it is typically the case that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
x.clone().equals(x)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
will be {@code true}, this is not an absolute requirement.
&lt;p&gt;
By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
{@code super.clone}.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except
{@code Object}) obey this convention, it will be the case that
{@code x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()}.
&lt;p&gt;
By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
by {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this means
copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal &quot;deep structure&quot;
of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
need to be modified.
&lt;p&gt;
The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a
specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
{@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
performs a &quot;shallow copy&quot; of this object, not a &quot;deep copy&quot; operation.
&lt;p&gt;
The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
{@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object
whose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an
exception at run time.
@return     a clone of this instance.
@throws  CloneNotSupportedException  if the object&#39;s class does not
support the {@code Cloneable} interface. Subclasses
that override the {@code clone} method can also
throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot
be cloned.

be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a
person to read.

&lt;p&gt;
The {@code toString} method for class {@code Object}
returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the
object is an instance, the at-sign character `{@code @}&#39;, and
the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the
object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the
value of:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

the discretion of the implementation. A thread waits on an object&#39;s
monitor by calling one of the {@code wait} methods.
&lt;p&gt;
The awakened thread will not be able to proceed until the current
thread relinquishes the lock on this object. The awakened thread will
compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might be
actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the
awakened thread enjoys no reliable privilege or disadvantage in being
the next thread to lock this object.
&lt;p&gt;
This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
of this object&#39;s monitor. A thread becomes the owner of the
object&#39;s monitor in one of three ways:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By executing a synchronized instance method of that object.
&lt;li&gt;By executing the body of a {@code synchronized} statement
that synchronizes on the object.
&lt;li&gt;For objects of type {@code Class,} by executing a
synchronized static method of that class.

&lt;p&gt;
The current thread must own this object&#39;s monitor lock. See the
{@link #notify notify} method for a description of the ways in which
a thread can become the owner of a monitor lock.
&lt;p&gt;
This method causes the current thread (referred to here as &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt;) to
place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish any
and all synchronization claims on this object. Note that only the locks
on this object are relinquished; any other objects on which the current
thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread waits.
&lt;p&gt;
Thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; then becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes
and lies dormant until one of the following occurs:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some other thread invokes the {@code notify} method for this
object and thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; happens to be arbitrarily chosen as
the thread to be awakened.
&lt;li&gt;Some other thread invokes the {@code notifyAll} method for this
object.
&lt;li&gt;Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.
The amount of real time, in nanoseconds, is given by the expression
{@code 1000000
timeoutMillis + nanos}. If {@code timeoutMillis} and {@code nanos}
are both zero, then real time is not taken into consideration and the
thread waits until awakened by one of the other causes.
&lt;li&gt;Thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; is awakened spuriously. (See below.)
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; is then removed from the wait set for this
object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It competes in the
usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
object; once it has regained control of the object, all its
synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the {@code wait}
method was invoked. Thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; then returns from the
invocation of the {@code wait} method. Thus, on return from the
{@code wait} method, the synchronization state of the object and of
thread {@code T} is exactly as it was when the {@code wait} method
was invoked.
&lt;p&gt;
A thread can wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a
so-called &lt;em&gt;spurious wakeup&lt;/em&gt;.  While this will rarely occur in practice,
applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should
have caused the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if the condition
is not satisfied. See the example below.
&lt;p&gt;
For more information on this topic, see section 14.2,
&quot;Condition Queues,&quot; in Brian Goetz and others&#39; &lt;em&gt;Java Concurrency
in Practice&lt;/em&gt; (Addison-Wesley, 2006) or Item 69 in Joshua
Bloch&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Effective Java, Second Edition&lt;/em&gt; (Addison-Wesley,
2008).
&lt;p&gt;
If the current thread is {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#interrupt() interrupted}
by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an {@code InterruptedException}
is thrown.  The &lt;em&gt;interrupted status&lt;/em&gt; of the current thread is cleared when
this exception is thrown. This exception is not thrown until the lock status of
this object has been restored as described above.
@apiNote
The recommended approach to waiting is to check the condition being awaited in
a {@code while} loop around the call to {@code wait}, as shown in the example
below. Among other things, this approach avoids problems that can be caused
by spurious wakeups.
&lt;pre&gt;{@code
synchronized (obj) {
while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt; and &lt;timeout not exceeded&gt;) {
long timeoutMillis = ... ; // recompute timeout values
int nanos = ... ;

            <td><p>Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
determines that there are no more references to the object.
A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
system resources or to perform other cleanup.
&lt;p&gt;
The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
if and when the Java&amp;trade; virtual
machine has determined that there is no longer any
means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
permanently discarded.
&lt;p&gt;
The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
{@code Object} may override this definition.
&lt;p&gt;
The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
&lt;p&gt;
After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
at which point the object may be discarded.
&lt;p&gt;
The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
virtual machine for any given object.
&lt;p&gt;
Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
ignored.
@apiNote
Classes that embed non-heap resources have many options
for cleanup of those resources. The class must ensure that the
lifetime of each instance is longer than that of any resource it embeds.
{@link java.lang.ref.Reference#reachabilityFence} can be used to ensure that
objects remain reachable while resources embedded in the object are in use.
&lt;p&gt;
A subclass should avoid overriding the {@code finalize} method
unless the subclass embeds non-heap resources that must be cleaned up
before the instance is collected.
Finalizer invocations are not automatically chained, unlike constructors.
If a subclass overrides {@code finalize} it must invoke the superclass
finalizer explicitly.
To guard against exceptions prematurely terminating the finalize chain,
the subclass should use a {@code try-finally} block to ensure
{@code super.finalize()} is always invoked. For example,
&lt;pre&gt;{@code      @Override
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
try {
... // cleanup subclass state
} finally {
super.finalize();
}
}
}&lt;/pre&gt;
@deprecated The finalization mechanism is inherently problematic.
Finalization can lead to performance issues, deadlocks, and hangs.
Errors in finalizers can lead to resource leaks; there is no way to cancel
finalization if it is no longer necessary; and no ordering is specified
among calls to {@code finalize} methods of different objects.
Furthermore, there are no guarantees regarding the timing of finalization.
The {@code finalize} method might be called on a finalizable object
only after an indefinite delay, if at all.
Classes whose instances hold non-heap resources should provide a method
to enable explicit release of those resources, and they should also
implement {@link AutoCloseable} if appropriate.
The {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner} and {@link java.lang.ref.PhantomReference}
provide more flexible and efficient ways to release resources when an object
becomes unreachable.
